PSoCEve is an open source library to control EVE graphic control chips from FTDI using Cypress PSoc microcontrollers.

Actually it is in a very aearly stage. There is support only for FT800 chip and for PSoC 4 family microcontrollers.

It is planned to add support for FT801 and newer EVE chips (FT81x) and for other PSoc microcontroller families (PSOC3 and PSOC5).

Sorry, not too much info for now. More info asap.
